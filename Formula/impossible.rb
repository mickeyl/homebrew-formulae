    <<~EOS
      Start the helper with:
        impossible-helper start

      Check whether it is running:
        impossible-helper status

      Auto-start at login:
        impossible-helper install

      The helper must be running before launching your iOS Simulator app.
      On first launch, macOS will prompt you to allow Bluetooth access.

      For configurable virtual BLE peripherals instead of real hardware:
        open #{opt_libexec}/ImpossiBLE-Mock.app
    EOS
  end
